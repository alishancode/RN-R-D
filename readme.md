# React Native Boilerplate and Project Generator

Easily set up a React Native project with a custom boilerplate. This guide walks you through creating a new Expo project, integrating a boilerplate, and organizing your project structure.

## How to Run  
Use the following command to execute the setup script:  
```bash
node index.js <project-name>
```

---

## Setup Steps

1. **Create a New Expo Project**  
   Generate a fresh Expo project:  
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest <project-name>
   ```

2. **Clone the Boilerplate Repository**  
   Clone the boilerplate repository to your project directory:  
   ```bash
   git clone <boilerplate-repo-url>
   ```

3. **Move Required Files**  
   Move the necessary files and directories (e.g., `src`, configuration files) from the boilerplate to your project root:  
   ```bash
   mv <boilerplate-folder>/src <project-name>/src
   ```

4. **Clean Up**  
   After transferring the required files, remove the boilerplate directory to keep your project tidy:  
   ```bash
   rm -rf <boilerplate-folder>
   ```

## Notes  
- Replace `<boilerplate-repo-url>` with the actual repository URL of your boilerplate.  
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies from the boilerplate are installed in your project.
